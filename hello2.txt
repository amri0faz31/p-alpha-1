this is  2nd 

"vi hello2.txt"

created this file in working directory

trying to figure out the colour of this in git status before adding it to staging area


2nd step

"git status" command showed file "hello2.txt" in  red


i.e any file in working directory is RED

now i will add this file to "staging" git add hello2.txt

3rd step

"git add hello2.txt" pushed the file in to the staging area

"git status" : showed "hello2.txt" in GREEN

4th step

making changes in this file ( the 3rd step is indeed counted as "updating the hello2 file becouse the reporting at 3 happened after staging the file)

indeed the file name was red 


"modified" indicates that the file a staged file with changes there for "git add ..." again


5th

here the "hello2.txt" that in red (modified) is "git add..." again

"git status " showed "hello2.txt" in GREEN
